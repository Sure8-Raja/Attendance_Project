#Assuming only one file name. Will have to modify for multiple file names and figure out a way of naming.

# Reading the File
f = open('path/workfile.att', 'r+')

# Splitting it
arr = f.split(".")

# Storing in the Database
a = reg(s_id=arr[0],s_name=arr[1],)
a.save()

# Move the file in another folder, namely “Processed”
shutil.move("path/to/current/file.att", "path/to/new/destination/for/file.att")
